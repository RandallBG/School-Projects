        <h4>20TH CENTURY USA</h4>
        <p>In the early 20th century three new states were admitted to the union, Oklahoma in 1907 and Arizona
            and New Mexico in 1912.</p>

        <p>Also in the early 20th century the USA built the Panama Canal. President Theodore Roosevelt decided to
            build a canal across Panama in 1902. In 1903 the USA leased a 6-mile wide canal zone for 99 years. The
            canal was built in the years 1904-1914. </p>

        <h4 class="secondaryTitle">THE USA IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR</h4>

        <p>When the First World War began in 1914 the USA remained neutral. However, Germany alienated
            American public opinion on 7 May 1915 when a German submarine sank the Cunard liner Lusitania,
            without warning. Among the 1,198 people killed were 128 Americans. Nevertheless, Woodrow Wilson
            fought the 1916 election partly on the slogan 'he kept us out of the war'.</p>

        <p>On 6 April 1917 the USA declared war on Germany. America had a strong navy but a relatively small
            army. However, conscription was introduced and the USA began to raise a huge army. The first US
            troops were sent to France in June 1917, but it was the spring of 1918 before large numbers arrived. By
            September the US commander General John J. Pershing was able to begin an offensive against the
            Germans. In September 1918 US troops destroyed a German salient at St Mihiel. They then launched an
            attack on the Meuse-Argonne area. German troops were pushed back until Germany surrendered on 11
            November 1918. </p>

        <h4>THE 1920'S</h4>

        <p>For most people (not all) the 1920s were a time of prosperity. In 1912 only 16% of homes had electric
            light. By 1927 it had risen to 63%. Electrical appliances became common, refrigerators, irons and
            fans.
            Radios also became common. By 1930 40% of homes had one. Cars also became common in the 1920s.
            Americans enjoyed the highest standard of living in the world. </p>
